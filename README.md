Color calibration guide for LG OLED TV



I'm writing this guide as a reference for color calibrating modern LG OLED TVs. It's using the open source [bscpylgtv](https://github.com/chros73/bscpylgtv) and [DisplayCAL](https://displaycal.net/) projects.

I'm using a G2 with the 04.x firmware. Feel free to open a Pull Request (or just click Edit here in GitHub) to add things related to different models. Also, please open a PR to correct if I write something wrong.

For calibrating I'm using a X-Rite i1 Display Pro series (i1D3) colorimeter. It has many different names, if it looks like this, it should work.
